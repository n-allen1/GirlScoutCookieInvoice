# GirlScoutCookieInvoice
This program is used to get an input of a customer's name and address and number of cookies requested per cookie type (currently in the range from 0 to 10 cookies).  Each cookie is set at $5.00. I upload this here, so as I learn, maybe someone else in the same skill level can practice and learn from code projects I do.
